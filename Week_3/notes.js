// Syncronous code
// Syncronous code is executed line by line, in the order its written.Each operation waits for the previous one to complete before moving on to the next one.

/* For example.

function sum(n){
    ans = 0;
    for(i=1; i<=n; i++){
        ans = ans + 1;
    }
    return ans;
}

const ans1 = sum(100);
console.log(ans1);
const ans2 = sum(200);
console.log(ans2);
const ans3 = sum(300);
console.log(ans3);
const ans4 = sum(400);
console.log(ans4);

/* I/O heavy operations

I/O heavy operations refer to tasks in a computer program
that involes a lot of data transfer between the program ans external system or device. These operations usually
require waiting for data to be read from or written to sources like disks, networks, databases,
or other external devices, which can be time-consuming compared to in-memory computations.
